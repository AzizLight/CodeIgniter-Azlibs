CodeIgniter Akismet Library
----------------------------

This Library has an MIT license that you can find in the LICENSE file.

Usage:
------

First you need to open the Azakis.php file, scroll down to the constructor (__construct)
and add your API key, Home URL and add your application's name and version to the 
beginning of the Application User Agent;

The Home URL is the url of the blog or site you want to use the library on.
The Application User Agent is a string that should have the following format:

	Application Name/Version | Azakis/0.01

You need to modify Application Name/Version to suit your site.

Now you can start using the library.

Load the library:

	$this->load->library('azakis');

You need to format your comment accordingly:

	$comment['author_name']    = '';
	$comment['author_website'] = '';
	$comment['author_email']   = '';
	$comment['body']           = '';
	$comment['permalink']      = '';

The permalink key is optional. Fill all the other ones with the info retrieved from the
comment form. ie:

	$comment['author_name']    = $this->input->post('name);
	$comment['author_website'] = $this->input->post('author_website');
	$comment['author_email']   = $this->input->post(''author_email);
	$comment['body']           = $this->input->post('body');

Now you can test if the comment is a spam by using the
is_spam() method:

	if ($this->azakis->is_spam($comment))
	{
		echo 'This comment is a spam!!';
	}
	else
	{
		echo 'This comment is interesting, definitely not a spam!';
	}

You can also set a comment as spam manually using the submit_spam() method:

	if ($this->submit_spam($comment))
	{
		echo 'spam submitted successfully!';
	}

The same way, you can submit a ham in case Akismet did a mistake using the submit_ham() method:

	if ($this->submit_ham($comment))
	{
		echo 'hpam submitted successfully!';
	}

That's all there is to it!
