This CodeIgniter authentication library was slightly inspired by the 
QuickAuth library (http://github.com/syntaxmonster/Codeigniter-Authentication-Library)
by David Blencowe (http://www.syntaxmonster.net).

At first it was based on that library, but then I ended up completely rewritting it from
scratch and created my own authentication library. I use the same license (MIT License),
you can find it in the LICENSE file in the same folder.

--------------------------------------------------------

In order for the library to work normally, don't forget to set an encryption key
in the config/config.php.

Also you NEED to autoload the database library and setup the database configuration
in config/database.php.

The code is very simple and well documented so you shouldn't have any problems using
the library right away. I'm going to right a seperate documentation as soon as I have
some free time.
